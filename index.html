            <h3>Why Rome?</h3>
            <h2>Rome, the eternal city</h2>
            <p>
              You have probably heard that Rome is called ‘’ The Eternal City.’’
              This nickname reflects enduring influence throughout history. The
              term first came from ancient Roman poets and writers who believed
              Rome would last forever – regardless of what happened in the
              world. This belief comes from the city’s incredible history and
              its central role in Western civilization. The phrase gained
              popularity during the Roman Empire, a period when Rome was at the
              height of its power. Romans created monumental structures like the
              Colosseum, Pantheon, and the Roman Forum, and even after the fall
              of the Roman Empire, Rome remains a symbol of resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rome is called the City of Fountains for a good reason – it boasts
              over 1500 fountains, more than any other city in the World. The
              fountains include grand and iconic structures like the Trevi
              Fountain, where visitors toss coins for good luck. You can find
              many smaller lesser known fountains hidden in charming piazzas
              around the city. Many of these places have a rich history dating
              back to the Roman Empire.

                The Trapizzino offers both indoor and outdoor dining and is an
                extremely popular spot for locals and tourists alike. There are
                no reservations available so expect a line for both take-out and
                dine-in if you are arriving at the restaurant during peak hours.

              <p>
                They specialize in a triangular pizza pocket made from wheat
                flour and Southern Italian yeast that has been kept alive for
                over 100 years, each Trapizzino is stuffed with a filling that
                gives it a pizza-like experience when bit into.
