          <h3>Why Rome?</h3>
          <h2>Rome, the eternal city</h2>
          <p>
            You have probably heard that Rome is called ‘’ The Eternal City.’’
            This nickname reflects enduring influence throughout history. The
            term first came from ancient Roman poets and writers who believed
            Rome would last forever – regardless of what happened in the world.
            This belief comes from the city’s incredible history and its central
            role in Western civilization. The phrase gained popularity during
            the Roman Empire, a period when Rome was at the height of its power.
            Romans created monumental structures like the Colosseum, Pantheon,
            and the Roman Forum, and even after the fall of the Roman Empire,
            Rome remains a symbol of resilience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rome is called the City of Fountains for a good reason – it boasts
            over 1500 fountains, more than any other city in the World. The
            fountains include grand and iconic structures like the Trevi
            Fountain, where visitors toss coins for good luck. You can find many
            smaller lesser known fountains hidden in charming piazzas around the
            city. Many of these places have a rich history dating back to the
            Roman Empire.
